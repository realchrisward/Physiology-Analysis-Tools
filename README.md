# Physiology-Analysis-Tools
Tools for analysis and visualization of physiological signals (ECG, EEG, EMG, BP, Plethysmography, Pneumotachography, Video, ...)

This software was driven by efforts of the Cardiovascular and Metabolism Working Group of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. 
It is intended to be a Free and Open Source Software Solution to aid in the analysis of physiological signals.
